Hello! You should be able to run project.py by just opening project.py in your IDE 
and installing the required libraries with:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

If it does not run, try extracting the files from the .zip to a new folder then running the .py.
I used VSCode, and Python 3.13.2

Also, I used parallel processing to make my project run faster (still took 2 hours and 15 minutes for me).
Sorry in advance if you run the program as the parallel processing will make your device laggy.

Please email me if you have any questions at:
